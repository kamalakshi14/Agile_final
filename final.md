# Understanding of Agile & Scrum Framework

Agile word means the ability to change quickly and easily. Agile methodology helps project teams to adapt faster and easier as compared to traditional methodology. Traditional software development methods try to find the best tools and processes while agile focus mainly on people and faster delivery of projects in iterations.
Agile methodology has techniques which plan project by dividing into various stages with continuous customer interaction. There is continuous monitoring of each and every step of software development cycle. Advantage of agile over waterfall is that development and testing are parallel and synchronized.
Agile methodology project management uses four values and 12 principles to organize projects. 

**The four values of the Agile Manifesto are:**
1.	We value individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2.	We value working software over comprehensive documentation
3.	We value customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4.	We value responding to change over following a plan

The Agile method works in iterations or sprints of project planning and execution which enables you to continuously adapt your plan, design and scope throughout the project. 
Agile projects require an iterative approach, which supports incremental, frequent, and constant delivery of working software products to your customer. This approach ensures your project team can consistently deliver products without being delayed by changes and evolving requirements.
