# Understanding of Agile & Scrum Framework

Agile word means the ability to change quickly and easily. Agile methodology helps project teams to adapt faster and easier as compared to traditional methodology. Traditional software development methods try to find the best tools and processes while agile focus mainly on people and faster delivery of projects in iterations.

Agile methodology has techniques which plan project by dividing into various stages with continuous customer interaction. There is continuous monitoring of each and every step of software development cycle. Advantage of agile over waterfall is that development and testing are parallel and synchronized.

Agile methodology project management uses four values and 12 principles to organize projects. 

**The four values of the Agile Manifesto are:**
1.	We value individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2.	We value working software over comprehensive documentation
3.	We value customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4.	We value responding to change over following a plan

The Agile method works in iterations or sprints of project planning and execution which enables you to continuously adapt your plan, design and scope throughout the project. 
Agile projects require an iterative approach, which supports incremental, frequent, and constant delivery of working software products to your customer. This approach ensures your project team can consistently deliver products without being delayed by changes and evolving requirements.

**1.	Customer Satisfaction:**
Our highest priority is to satisfy customers by delivering product early with continuous delivery of software.  This principle states customers should receive deliverables in iterations throughout the projects life cycle instead of single product delivery at the end.

**2.	Welcome changing requirements:**
In traditional project management, it was difficult to incorporate last-minute changes to requirement. This principle states that agile projects can adapt last-minute changes too.

**3.	Deliver working software frequently:**
Agile project plan for short period timeline to deliver faster. Teams break whole project into small parts called sprints, each ending with working part of software. Usually, sprints are four week long timeline.

**4.	Collaborate Daily:**
This agile principle states business people work together with development team daily throughout the project. This involves short daily meetings of stakeholders and development team.

**5.	Motivated individuals:**
Agile project management methodology believes that right people should be placed in the right positions. They should be given autonomy to do their job well. The project manager should focus on keep team members motivated than micromanaging them.

**6.	Face to face conversation:**
The most effective method to convey information to and within team is face-to-face conversation. Agile project management methodology promotes face to face conversations rather than phone or email.  

**7.	Working software matters:**
Working software is the primary measure of progress.  Agile methodology focus on to provide complete and working software.

**8.	Constant pace:**
This principle states that agile projects should have a consistent pace for each iterative cycle or sprint within the project. Agile processes promotes sustainable development. 

**9.	High quality code faster:**
Agile project focus should be on improving end product constantly over time. There should be continuous attention to technical excellence. Each iteration must be improved than previous one, and team should always work to improve it.

**10.	Maximizing the amount of work not done:**
Simplicity is the art of maximizing the work not done. This idea is central to eliminating waste. To make your process more agile, do less, focus on high priority items. Any additional documentation, processes or steps that does not add value to the customer or refine the project outputs should be avoided.

**11.	Self-organizing team deliver quality:**
Agile is based on the belief that you need motivated and skilled teams to deliver the best results and products. Teams should be empowered to organize themselves as required. They should have the freedom to collaborate and innovate as the way they can without any oversight.

**12.	Feedback loops used to improve:** 
Team should always try to improve in skills and processes to grow. The team should have regular reviews on their performance and outcomes, including discussions on improving as they move forward.

In this tutorial we will focus on scrum development methodology.

## Scrum 
One of the popular method of agile is scrum development framework. In which software is delivered in various cycles of development. Scrum methodology breaks projects into small parts as deliverables and each cycle of delivery is called as “Sprints”. Usually, one sprints is approximately 4 weeks. Scrum and agile methods focus on continuous delivery of software. 

Scrum team includes product owners, scrum master and development team. Development team includes testers, designers, developers and UX specialists. 

**Product Owner:** 
Product owner are responsible to understand business, customer and market requirement.  They build and manage product backlog, give team guidance which feature deliver next and decide when to ship product to customer.

**Scrum Master:** 
Scrum masters coach team, product owners and business about agile processes. Scrum master is facilitator to team who understand work done by team and help them to optimize delivery flow. Scrum master schedules resources for sprint planning, sprint review, sprint retrospective and stand-ups.

**Scrum Development team:**
Scrum team are best in sustainable development practices. Scrum team normally have five to seven members. They have different skill sets but cross-train so that no one becomes bottleneck in the delivery work. All team members help each other to make sure a successful sprint completion.
 
## Scrum workflow 

In scrum workflow works on the process of regular customized continuous feedback loops.
Below diagram shows basic workflow of the Scrum framework.

### Product backlog creation    
Product backlog creation is the first stage of scrum workflow where stakeholders decide list of features should be implemented and developed in product roadmap. Product owner in collaboration with the team decides user stories or requirement of project. In scrum framework, features are known as user stories. Product owner decide which user stories should be kept in product backlog. 

### Sprint Planning 
Sprint is timeframe where team performs a set tasks from backlog. The average time of sprint one sprint is 2-4 weeks. Each sprint takes set of tasks from product backlog and get ready to release state. A sprint iteration contains subset of tasks from the product backlog is called as sprint backlog. 

### Daily Scrum 
After sprint planning completed means user stories are selected and the development process starts. Task boards are created for each task or user stories with its description needed for implementation. After code is written it’s tested and finally make it ready to deliver. Daily scrum meeting held to check status of sprint goal and accordingly make changes in sprint plan. Duration of meeting approximately 15 minutes to get correct information about current progress of sprint.
Everyone in the communicated about the amount of work done and what are challenges they faced to complete user stories. 

### Sprint Review
After all the user stories completed and sprint backlog is done means sprint is completed. Sprint review is held after sprint completion. In sprint review working software demonstration is done. Customer checks for the acceptance. Based on the customer feedback further changes are incorporated.

### Sprint Retrospective and next sprint planning

In the sprint retrospective meeting conducted and askes themselves what could be done to improve themselves.

- What went wrong?
- What did not go well?
- What things should be done to improve in next sprint?
  
Approximate time duration of retrospective is 90 minutes. This helps to give important point to be considered in the next sprint. 
Scrum is very simple to understand. Its agility and continuous feedback make difference than traditional waterfall model. Scrum workflow assists regular team members for changes and speed up project management process.
